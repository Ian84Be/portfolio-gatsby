            I have been interested in internet technologies for a long time. One
            of my earliest memories is that of my father and my brother talking
            about the World Wide Web, they had just bought a computer and set it
            up in our basement, their faces glowing with an excitement I could
            not understand. The world wide web. I imagined a giant spider, but
            what does it have to do with that beige colored television?

            My professional career started by enrolling as a full-time student
            at Lambda School. I was also hired by Lambda School to be a Team
            Lead. My role was to manage, and mentor a group of new students
            through their first 16 weeks of learning. After a year of study I
            applied for my first software engineering job, and was quickly hired
            by Gulf Winds Credit Union. I am grateful to Lambda School for
            delivering exactly what they promised, and to Gulf Winds for giving
            me the opportunity to start a new career.

            Over the past year I have learned an esoteric programming language
            (PowerOn), and used it to automate processes which saved over 750
            hours of manual labor. I also worked with SQL and SSRS to create
            custom reporting for departmental stakeholders. When a vendor
            contract for ‚ÄúLobbyTracking‚Äù software was due to expire, I was named
            tech lead for an internal development project and tasked to build a
            replacement within 6 months. Using React, Express, Postgres, and
            working alongside 1 other engineer, we were able to deliver all
            features as promised: on deadline. Our work allowed the credit union
            to cancel a contract which was costing them $40k annually.
