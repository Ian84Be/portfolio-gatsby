            I have been interested in internet technologies for a long time. One
            of my earliest memories is that of my father and my brother talking
            about the World Wide Web, they had just bought a computer and set it
            up in our basement, their faces glowing with an excitement I could
            not understand. The world wide web. I imagined a giant spider, but
            what does it have to do with that beige colored television?

            My journey in tech started by enrolling as a full-time student at
            Lambda School. It was an intense and rewarding experience to say the
            least. I was also hired by Lambda School to be a Team Lead. My role
            was to manage, and mentor a group of new students through their
            first 16 weeks of learning. After a long year of study I applied for
            my first software engineering job, and was quickly hired by Gulf
            Winds Credit Union. I am grateful to Lambda School for delivering
            exactly what they promised, and to Gulf Winds for giving me the
            opportunity to start a new career.

            Over the past year I have learned an esoteric programming language
            (PowerOn), and used it to automate processes which saved over 300
            hours of manual labor. I also worked with SQL and SSRS to create
            custom reporting for departmental stakeholders. When a vendor
            contract for ‚ÄúLobby Tracking‚Äù software was due to expire, I was
            named tech lead for an internal development project and tasked to
            build a replacement within 6 months. Working alongside 1 other
            engineer, we were able to deliver all features as promised: on
            deadline. Our work allowed the credit union to cancel a contract
            which was costing them $40k annually.

            When I am not staring into screens I like to play guitar, cook food,
            read books, and go outside, sometimes in that exact order.
